= Introduction =

!GameBoost (abbreviated: gb, or GB) is a collection of libraries to help an ordinary C++ game developer making his new masterpiece.

!GameBoost is not a game engine, it's more like a toolbox: you can use required set of components and classes to develop your own game engine or game project.

Contains libraries for rendering, math, logic and AI, animations, input and event handling, content loaders, crossplatform support, filesystem abstraction and more.
